          <h2>The St John's College Ultimate Frisbee Team</h4>
          <h3>Welcome!</h3>
          <p>Congratulations on taking the first step to self-enlightenment by visiting the St Johnâ€™s Ultimate Frisbee website. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a complete beginner who has never thrown a disc before, you're more than welcome to come along and play ultimate with Johns.</p>
          <p>Ultimate is a game played by two mixed-sex teams of seven, involving a pitch with two end-zones, a disc and a lot of fun. Have a nosey around the internet if you want to find out more (the <a href="http://www.strangeblue.org/rules-quick">strange blue website</a> has a good explanation of the rules), or even better, come along to a practice session and find out from first-hand experience.</p>
          <p>If you want to be added to the mailing list, come to any training sessions or have any questions, feel free to get in touch (jaa56@cam.ac.uk).</p>
